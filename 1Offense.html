    <h1>Offense</h1>
    <h2>
      The offensive players on a football team are in charge of getting the football from one side of the field to another.
      They consist of 11 players, as does the defense. There is always one quarterback, and a variation of linemen, runningbacks, receivers, and tight ends.
      Whenever the offense has the ball, they try to move it across the field either through passing or running the ball. Each instance where the football is moved is called a play.
      After every play, a down is counted. The offense has 4 downs, or opportunities, to get a first down. Every 10 yards, a first down is achieved.
      If the team cannot convert within 4 downs, the other team gains possession of the football and has a chance to score. This is where the <a href="1Defense.html">Defense</a> comes in.
